# dot-pip

My pip dotfiles.

These are personalized for my own usage, but you can use them however you'd
like.

They're optimized for speed (all packages are cached locally), and reliability
(alternate pip mirrors will be used if the official PyPI site goes down).


## Installation

The below commands will download the project, and setup pip.

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rdegges/dot-pip.git ~/.pip
```
